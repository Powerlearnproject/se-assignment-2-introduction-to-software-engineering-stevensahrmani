Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
ANS: Software engineering involves the definition, implementation, testing, management and maintenance of software systems and with development of the software development process itself. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
ANS: Software engineering involves applying a systematic approach to design, build, and maintain programs efficiently and effectively. On the other hand traditional progrmaming is the use of specific programming language to create a specific prgram. One writer puts it like this: programming is like building the walls and roof whilst Software engineering is like designing the entire house, overseeing its construction, and ensuring it's structurally sound and meets all requirements. Source: https://www.quora.com/Are-software-engineering-coding-and-programming-the-same-thing-If-not-whats-the-difference.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
ANS: SDLC is a process followed for software building within a software organization which consists of a precise plan that describes how to develop, maintain, replace, and enhance specific software. The life cycle defines a method for improving the quality of software and the all-around development process. Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-development-life-cycle-sdlc/

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
ANS: Software Development Life Cycle or SDLC is divided into five main phases or stages, which are listed below:
1. Initiation: Define project goals and objectives. Conduct feasibility studies. Identify stakeholders. Develop project charter.
2. Planning: Develop project management plan. Define scope, schedule, and budget. Plan resources, communication, and ris management.
3. Execution: Assign tasks to team members. Implement project plans. Manage teams and communication. Ensure quality assurance processes are followed
4. Monitoring and Controlling: Track project progress. Perform quality control. Manage changes to scope, schedule, and costs. Report performance to stakeholders.
5. Closure: Finalize all project activities. Obtain formal acceptance of deliverables. Release project resources. Document lessons learned and archive project documents Source: PLP 2024 Cohort lectures

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
ANS: Both agile and waterfall models are considered as software development models or methodologies. In Agile development methodology, teams use this development methodology to minimize risk (such as bugs, cost overruns, and changing requirements) when adding new functionality. In all agile methods, teams develop the software in iterations that contain mini-increments of the new functionality. There are many different forms of the agile development method, including scrum, crystal, extreme programming (XP), and feature-driven development (FDD).

Pros: The primary benefit of agile software development is that it allows software to be released in iterations. Iterative releases improve efficiency by allowing teams to find and fix defects and align expectation early on. They also allow users to realize software benefits earlier, with frequent incremental improvements.
Cons: Agile development methods rely on real-time communication, so new users often lack the documentation they need to get up to speed. They require a huge time commitment from users and are labor intensive because developers must fully complete each feature within each iteration for user approval
Examples of software products and companies that use the Agile methodology are: Spotify, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce, IBM, Dropbox, Atlassian, Adobe, Intuit, etc..

On the other hand many consider the waterfall method to be the most traditional software development method. The waterfall method is a rigid linear model that consists of sequential phases (requirements, design, implementation, verification, maintenance) focusing on distinct goals. Each phase must be 100% complete before the next phase can start. There’s usually no process for going back to modify the project or direction. Source: https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/top-4-software-development-methodologies.html

Pros: -Clear structure and documentation. -Easy to manage due to its rigidity.
Cons: -Difficult to accommodate changes. -Testing occurs late in the process Source: PLP 2024 Cohort lectures

Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
ANS: Requirements Engineering is the process of identifying, eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-requirements-engineering-process/

Requirement engineering is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) that involves the systematic process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements. Here’s an overview of the process:
1. Feasibility Study: This initial phase assesses the project’s viability by examining technical, economic, legal, operational, and schedule feasibility. Requirements Elicitation: This step involves gathering knowledge about the project domain and requirements from various stakeholders through interviews, surveys, workshops, and other methods.
2. Requirements Specification: The elicited requirements are then documented in a formal manner to produce software requirement models.
3. Requirements Verification and Validation: This phase ensures that the requirements are correct, complete, unambiguous, and testable. It involves reviewing the requirements with stakeholders and performing various checks.
4. Requirements Management: Throughout the project, requirements may change. This step involves managing these changes systematically to ensure that the project remains aligned with stakeholder needs. Each of these steps is crucial for ensuring that the final software product meets user expectations and system functionality Source: Copilot.

Software Design Principles:
ANS: Software design principles are guidelines and best practices that help software engineers create high-quality, maintainable, and efficient software systems. They provide a framework for designing, implementing, and testing software applications in a way that meets the specific requirements of the project and the needs of the users.

Key Software Design Principles:
1. Single Responsibility Principle: Each class, module, or function should have a single, well-defined purpose. This simplifies maintenance, reduces coupling, and improves cohesion.
2. Open-Closed Principle: Software should be open for extension but closed for modification. New functionality should be added through inheritance or composition.
3. Liskov Substitution Principle: Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes without breaking the program. This ensures that objects can be used interchangeably and enhances code flexibility.
4. Interface Segregation Principle: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. Split large interfaces into smaller, specific interfaces to improve flexibility and reduce coupling.
5. Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. This reduces coupling and makes it easier to change low-level components without affecting high-level functionality.
6. DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself): Avoid repeating the same code or logic in multiple places. Use abstraction, inheritance, or polymorphism to share common functionality and reduce code duplication.
7. Law of Demeter (Minimization of Coupling): Objects should only interact with a small number of other objects. This reduces coupling and improves encapsulation.
8. Cohesion: Classes, modules, and functions should have a strong internal focus and perform a single, well-defined task. This enhances maintainability and reduces the likelihood of bugs.
9. Coupling: The degree of interdependence between modules or components in a software system. Low coupling is desirable as it makes changes easier and reduces ripple effects.
10. Encapsulation: The bundling of data and methods into a single unit that protects the internal implementation from external access. This improves security, simplifies maintenance, and enhances code readability.
Benefits of Following Design Principles: -Improved software quality and reliability -Increased maintainability and reusability -Reduced coupling and improved flexibility -Enhanced testability and reduced debugging time -Increased development productivity Source: Gemini

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Benefits of Modularity:
1. Reduced Complexity: Modular design helps manage complexity by breaking down a large system into smaller, more manageable units.
2. Increased Maintainability: Individual modules can be easily modified, updated, or replaced without affecting the entire system. Improved Cohesion: Modules are designed to perform a specific task, leading to high internal cohesion and low coupling with other modules.
3. Enhanced Reusability: Modules can be reused in other software applications, reducing development time and effort.
4. Improved Scalability : Adding or removing modules can easily extend or shrink the system.

Principles of Modularity:
1. High Cohesion: Each module should focus on performing a specific task well.
2. Low Coupling: Modules should minimize dependencies on each other to reduce interdependency and improve flexibility.
3. Clear Interfaces: Interfaces define how modules interact with each other and should be well-defined and standardized.
4. Loose Coupling: Modules should be connected loosely through interfaces, enabling easy replacement or modification.
5. Information Hiding: Modules should encapsulate their internal implementation to prevent unwanted access or modification.

Types of Modules: 
1. Functional Modules: Perform specific tasks related to the application's functionality (e.g., data access, user interface).
2. Component Modules: Reusable software components that provide common functionality (e.g., logging, authentication).
3. Service Modules: Provide services to other modules, such as database connectivity or caching.
4. Layer Modules: Grouped into layers based on their dependencies, such as data layer, business logic layer, and presentation layer.

Implementation Techniques: 
1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes and objects can represent modules with encapsulation and inheritance.
2. Component-Based Development (CBD): Pre-built components can be assembled to create applications.
3. Interface Definition Languages (IDLs): Standardized interfaces specify how modules communicate.

Example: A payroll management system can be modularized into the following components:
1. Data Access Module: Manages data access and retrieval from the database.
2. Calculation Module: Performs payroll calculations, such as deductions and bonuses.
